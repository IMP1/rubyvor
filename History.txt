=== 0.0.7 / 2008-12-12

* Bugfix: there are cases where performing a Delaunay triangulation on a set of points will not yield a complete nearest neighbor graph. This causes computation of the minimum spanning tree and clustering to fail for these nodes (they always appear as disconnected from the main graph).

* To fix this, the nn_graph function now treats any point that is excluded from Delaunay triangulation as having *all* other points as nearest neighbors. This is a naive approach, but is a good fix while a more efficient solution is considered.

=== 0.0.6 / 2008-12-11

* Implementation of cluster_by_size to partition points into N clusters.

=== 0.0.5 / 2008-12-10

* Beginnings of clustering and useful graph algorithms.
* Some refactoring of C methods.

=== 0.0.4 / 2008-12-04

* Fixed 64-bit segfaults due to improper definition of the myrealloc() function.

=== 0.0.3 / 2008-12-03

* Fixed a segfault by using rb_ary_push instead of direct pointer manipulation. Much simpler.

=== 0.0.2 / 2008-12-03

* Computations succeed on a naive Point class, returning raw values for the associated Voronoi Diagram and Delaunay triangulation.

=== 0.0.1 / 2008-12-01

* Initial release. Nothing works.
